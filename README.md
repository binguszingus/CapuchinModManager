# MechanicMonke Beta
This is a successor to [MonkeModManager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager) that:
- Remains fully compatable with all MMM mods (including MakeRelease.ps1)
- Has it's own catalog and filtering system that includes the original MMM mod list
- Can detect what mods are installed based off of the filename or certain keywords in the naming scheme and update them accordingly
